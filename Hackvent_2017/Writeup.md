# HackVent 2017

Another edition of Hacking-Lab's annual advent calender CTF. Every day between December 1 and Christmas, a new challenge is released. Solve it on the day of release for maximum points, solve it later (but before the new year) for one point less.

## Hidden 03: 1984
While trying a day which doesn't have a challenge I got a strange error message with a ressource #:
![](Ressources/hidden_1984.png)

Let's try to match #0 which is 1984 and it reveals the flag:

## Hidden 05: Gift
Thanks to Day 06 I've got a new domain to play with: challenges.hackvent.hacking-lab.com
After a portscan it reveils that telnet is open
```bash
nmap -Pn -F challenges.hackvent.hacking-lab.com
```
```
Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-12-06 20:31 CET
Nmap scan report for challenges.hackvent.hacking-lab.com (80.74.140.188)
Host is up (0.041s latency).
rDNS record for 80.74.140.188: urb80-74-140-188.ch-meta.net
Not shown: 96 filtered ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
23/tcp  open  telnet
80/tcp  open  http
443/tcp open  https

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 4.26 seconds
```

After the connection it plays a little "video" with Santa who wants to give me a gift. Unfortunately I need to assemble it by myself. But it is freaking fast. Python will help with this:
```python
from socket import *

host = "challenges.hackvent.hacking-lab.com"
s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((host, 23))
flag = open('flag.txt', 'w')
active = False
print('Aquiring flag')
print('Please wait...')
while True:
	data = s.recv(2048)
	if active == True:
		flag.write(data)

	if "OWN." in data:
		active = True
		print('Flag saving activated')
	if data.encode('utf-8') == "":
		print('Flag aquired. see in flag.txt')
		break
```
```
Aquiring flag
Please wait...
Flag saving activated
Flag quired. see in flag.txt
```
```

## Day 01: 5th anniversary   
### Description
Day 01: 5th anniversary
time to have a look back

![](Ressources/HV17-hv16-hv15-hv14.svg)

### Solution
Thanks to shiltemann for the writeups of the years 2014,2015 and 2016 to get the flags.

## Day 02: Wishlist
### Description
Day 02: Wishlist  
The fifth power of two

[Wishlist.txt](./Ressources/Wishlist.txt)

### Solution
```2^5 = 32```

So we can assume that it is base32 encoded. But after the first run, we just got another base32 encoded string.

Let's solve this with python:
```python
import base64

f = open('./Wishlist.txt', 'r')
data = f.read()
while True:
    data = base64.b64decode(data)
    if "HV17" in data:
        print data
        break
```
```

## Day 03: Strange Logcat Entry
### Description
Day 03: Strange Logcat Entry
Lost in messages

I found those strange entries in my Android logcat, but I don't know what it's all about... I just want to read my messages!
[logcat.txt](./Ressources/logcat.txt)

### Solution
Inside the logcat entries is one special interessting
```
11-13 20:40:24.044	137	  137  DEBUG: I 07914400000000F001000B913173317331F300003AC7F79B0C52BEC52190F37D07D1C3EB32888E2E838CECF05907425A63B7161D1D9BB7D2F337BB459E8FD12D188CDD6E85CFE931
```

This is a PDU message (SMS). With the help of [https://www.diafaan.com/sms-tutorials/gsm-modem-tutorial/online-sms-pdu-decoder/](https://www.diafaan.com/sms-tutorials/gsm-modem-tutorial/online-sms-pdu-decoder/) I was able to decode the message:

## Day 04: HoHoHo
### Description
Santa has hidden something for you [Here (Orignial)](./Ressources/HoHoHo_medium.pdf) [Here (Simplified)](./Ressources/HoHoHo.pdf)

### Solution
In the PDF is a custom font embedded. In the simplified version, it is an attachment.
Open the font in Fontforge and you'll see that it doesn't have all availabe chars in it. But it has a lot of unprintable...

After playing a bit with the display options and enabling "Fit to font bounding box" of Fontforge I was able to show their content and voilÃ

## Day 05
### Description

Here is your flag:
```
0x69355f71
0xc2c8c11c
0xdf45873c
0x9d26aaff
0xb1b827f4
0x97d1acf4
```
and the one and only hint:

0xFE8F9017 XOR 0x13371337

### Solution
```0xFE8F9017 XOR 0x13371337 = 0xedb88320```  
0xedb88320 is a known CRC32 Polynom.
6 CRC32 checksums means 1 checksum per part of the flag. Luckly it is possible to reverse CRC32 checksums up to 5 bytes.

```python
import string
import itertools

def crc_message(msg):
    crc = 0 ^ 0xFFFFFFFF
    for i in msg:
        crc = crc32(ord(i), crc, )
    return crc ^ 0xFFFFFFFF


def crc32(byte, crc):
    crc ^= byte
    for k in range(0, 8):
        if crc & 1:
            crc = (crc >> 1) ^ crc_polynom
        else:
            crc = crc >> 1
    return crc

def crc_with_table(msg, table):
    pass

def brute(target_hash):
    baseChars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    for i in itertools.product(baseChars, baseChars, baseChars, baseChars):
        joined = ''.join(i)
        print("Testing %s" % joined)
        if crc_message(joined) == target_hash:
            return joined

def gen_table(polynom):
    table = []
    for i in range(0, 256):
        entry = i
        for j in range(8, 0, -1):
            if entry & 1:
               entry = (entry >> 1) ^ polynom
            else:
                entry >>=1
        table.append(entry)
    
    return table

def patch(wanted):
    w = wanted ^ 0xFFFFFFFF
    table = []
    for i in range(0, len(crc_table)):
        table.append(crc_table[i])

    table.sort()
    message = []
    r = []
    width = 4
    hash = 0xFFFFFFFF
    for p in range(0, width):
        message.append((hash & (256**(p+1)-1)) >> (8 * p))
    for p in range(0, width):
        message.append((w & (256**(p+1)-1)) >> (8 * p))
    for p in range(width - 1, -1, -1):
        o = table[message[p+width]]
        for q in range(0,width):
            v = (o & (256**(q+1)-1)) >> (8 * q)
            message[p+q+1] = message[p+q+1] ^ v
        message[p] = message[p] ^ crc_table.index(o)
    for p in range(0, width):
        r += chr(message[p])
    return r

keys = [
    0x69355f71,
    0xc2c8c11c,
    0xdf45873c,
    0x9d26aaff,
    0xb1b827f4,
    0x97d1acf4
]

crc_polynom = 0xedb88320
crc_table = gen_table(crc_polynom)

for key in keys:
    #print(brute(key))
    print(''.join(patch(key)))
```

## Day 06: Santa's journey
### Description
Follow Santa Claus as he makes his journey around the world.  
[http://challenges.hackvent.hacking-lab.com:4200/](http://challenges.hackvent.hacking-lab.com:4200/)

### Solution
The URL returns a random QR code which resolves to the name of a country.  
Let's be silly and just parse all QR-Codes until the flag occurs (It worked!)

```python
import qreader
import requests
import sys
from io import BytesIO

countries = {}
while True:
    url = 'http://challenges.hackvent.hacking-lab.com:4200/'
    content = requests.get(url).content

    data = qreader.read(BytesIO(content))
    print(data)  # prints "Version 2"
    if "HV17" in data:
        print('Found the flag: ' + data)
        sys.exit()
```
```

## Day 07: i know ...
... what you did last xmas
### Description
We were able to steal a file from santas computer. We are sure, he prepared a gift and there are traces for it in this file.

Please help us to recover it:

[SANTA.FILE](./Ressources/SANTA.FILE)

### Solution
```file SANTA.FILE``` describes it as a zip:
```
SANTA.FILE: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract
```
After unzip I've got the file SANTA.IMA which is according to ```file``` a 
```
SANTA.IMA: DOS/MBR boot sector
```

Let's be once again silly and check if the flag is direct inside this image:
```bash
$ hexdump -C SANTA.IMA | grep -A 1 "HV17"
000a7f90  65 6e 74 5c 48 56 31 37  2d 55 43 79 7a 2d 30 79  |ent\HV17-UCyz-0y|
000a7fa0  45 55 2d 64 39 30 4f 2d  76 53 71 53 2d 53 64 36  |EU-d90O-vSqS-Sd6|
```
```
Solution: HV17-UCyz-0yEU-d90O-vSqS-Sd6
```
