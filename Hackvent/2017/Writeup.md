# HackVent 2016

Another edition of Hacking-Lab's annual advent calender CTF. Every day between December 1 and Christmas, a new challenge is released. Solve it on the day of release for maximum points, solve it later (but before the new year) for one point less.

## Hidden: 1984
While trying a day which doesn't have a challenge I got a strange error message with a ressource #:
![](Ressources/hidden_1984.png)

Let's try to match #0 which is 1984 and it reveals the flag:

## Day 01
### Description
Day 01: 5th anniversary
time to have a look back

![](Ressources/HV17-hv16-hv15-hv14.svg)

### Solution
Thanks to shiltemann for the writeups of the years 2014,2015 and 2016 to get the flags.

Flag 2016: HV16-t8Kd-38aY-QxL5-bn4K-c6Lw
```

## Day 02
### Description
Day 02: Wishlist  
The fifth power of two

[Wishlist.txt](./Ressources/Wishlist.txt)

### Solution
```2^5 = 32```

So we can assume that it is base32 encoded. But after the first run, we just got another base32 encoded string.

Let's solve this with python:
```python
import base64

f = open('./Wishlist.txt', 'r')
data = f.read()
while True:
    data = base64.b64decode(data)
    if "HV17" in data:
        print data
        break
```
```
Solution: HV17-Th3F-1fth-Pow3-r0f2-is32

## Day 03
### Description
Day 03: Strange Logcat Entry
Lost in messages

I found those strange entries in my Android logcat, but I don't know what it's all about... I just want to read my messages!
[logcat.txt](./Ressources/logcat.txt)

### Solution
Inside the logcat entries is one special interessting
```
11-13 20:40:24.044	137	  137  DEBUG: I 07914400000000F001000B913173317331F300003AC7F79B0C52BEC52190F37D07D1C3EB32888E2E838CECF05907425A63B7161D1D9BB7D2F337BB459E8FD12D188CDD6E85CFE931
```

This is a PDU message (SMS). With the help of [https://www.diafaan.com/sms-tutorials/gsm-modem-tutorial/online-sms-pdu-decoder/](https://www.diafaan.com/sms-tutorials/gsm-modem-tutorial/online-sms-pdu-decoder/) I was able to decode the message:

## Day 04
### Description
Santa has hidden something for you [Here (Orignial)](./Ressources/HoHoHo_medium.pdf) [Here (Simplified)](./Ressources/HoHoHo.pdf)

### Solution
In the PDF is a custom font embedded. In the simplified version, it is an attachment.
Open the font in Fontforge and you'll see that it doesn't have all availabe chars in it. But it has a lot of unprintable...

After playing a bit with the display options and enabling "Fit to font bounding box" of Fontforge I was able to show their content and voilÃ

## Day 05
### Description

Here is your flag:
```
0x69355f71
0xc2c8c11c
0xdf45873c
0x9d26aaff
0xb1b827f4
0x97d1acf4
```
and the one and only hint:

0xFE8F9017 XOR 0x13371337

### Solution
```0xFE8F9017 XOR 0x13371337 = 0xedb88320```  
0xedb88320 is a known CRC32 Polynom.
6 CRC32 checksums means 1 checksum per part of the flag. Luckly it is possible to reverse CRC32 checksums up to 5 bytes.

```python
import string
import itertools

def crc_message(msg):
    crc = 0 ^ 0xFFFFFFFF
    for i in msg:
        crc = crc32(ord(i), crc, )
    return crc ^ 0xFFFFFFFF


def crc32(byte, crc):
    crc ^= byte
    for k in range(0, 8):
        if crc & 1:
            crc = (crc >> 1) ^ crc_polynom
        else:
            crc = crc >> 1
    return crc

def crc_with_table(msg, table):
    pass

def brute(target_hash):
    baseChars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    for i in itertools.product(baseChars, baseChars, baseChars, baseChars):
        joined = ''.join(i)
        print("Testing %s" % joined)
        if crc_message(joined) == target_hash:
            return joined

def gen_table(polynom):
    table = []
    for i in range(0, 256):
        entry = i
        for j in range(8, 0, -1):
            if entry & 1:
               entry = (entry >> 1) ^ polynom
            else:
                entry >>=1
        table.append(entry)
    
    return table

def patch(wanted):
    w = wanted ^ 0xFFFFFFFF
    table = []
    for i in range(0, len(crc_table)):
        table.append(crc_table[i])

    table.sort()
    message = []
    r = []
    width = 4
    hash = 0xFFFFFFFF
    for p in range(0, width):
        message.append((hash & (256**(p+1)-1)) >> (8 * p))
    for p in range(0, width):
        message.append((w & (256**(p+1)-1)) >> (8 * p))
    for p in range(width - 1, -1, -1):
        o = table[message[p+width]]
        for q in range(0,width):
            v = (o & (256**(q+1)-1)) >> (8 * q)
            message[p+q+1] = message[p+q+1] ^ v
        message[p] = message[p] ^ crc_table.index(o)
    for p in range(0, width):
        r += chr(message[p])
    return r

keys = [
    0x69355f71,
    0xc2c8c11c,
    0xdf45873c,
    0x9d26aaff,
    0xb1b827f4,
    0x97d1acf4
]

crc_polynom = 0xedb88320
crc_table = gen_table(crc_polynom)

for key in keys:
    #print(brute(key))
    print(''.join(patch(key)))
```
