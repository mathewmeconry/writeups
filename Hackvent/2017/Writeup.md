## Hidden: 1984
While trying a day which doesn't have a challenge I got a strange error message with a ressource #:
![](Ressources/hidden_1984.png)

Let's try to match #0 which is 1984 and it reveals the flag:

## Day 01
### Description
Day 01: 5th anniversary
time to have a look back

![](Ressources/HV17-hv16-hv15-hv14.svg)

### Solution
Thanks to shiltemann for the writeups of the years 2014,2015 and 2016 to get the flags.

Flag 2016: HV16-t8Kd-38aY-QxL5-bn4K-c6Lw
```
```

## Day 02
### Description
Day 02: Wishlist  
The fifth power of two

[Wishlist.txt](./Ressources/Wishlist.txt)

### Solution
```2^5 = 32```

So we can assume that it is base32 encoded. But after the first run, we just got another base32 encoded string.

Let's solve this with python:
```python
import base64

f = open('./Wishlist.txt', 'r')
data = f.read()
while True:
    data = base64.b64decode(data)
    if "HV17" in data:
        print data
        break
```
```
Solution: HV17-Th3F-1fth-Pow3-r0f2-is32
```

## Day 03
### Description
Day 03: Strange Logcat Entry
Lost in messages

I found those strange entries in my Android logcat, but I don't know what it's all about... I just want to read my messages!
[logcat.txt](./Ressources/logcat.txt)

### Solution
Inside the logcat entries is one special interessting
```

```

This is a PDU message (SMS). With the help of [https://www.diafaan.com/sms-tutorials/gsm-modem-tutorial/online-sms-pdu-decoder/](https://www.diafaan.com/sms-tutorials/gsm-modem-tutorial/online-sms-pdu-decoder/) I was able to decode the message:

## Day 04
### Description
Santa has hidden something for you [Here (Orignial)](./Ressources/HoHoHo_medium.pdf) [Here (Simplified)](./Ressources/HoHoHo.pdf)

### Solution
In the PDF is a custom font embedded. In the simplified version, it is an attachment.
Open the font in Fontforge and you'll see that it doesn't have all availabe chars in it. But it has a lot of unprintable...

After playing a bit with the display options and enabling "Fit to font bounding box" of Fontforge I was able to show their content and voil√†
